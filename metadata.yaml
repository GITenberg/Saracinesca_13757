description: "Saracinesca is a novel by F. Marion Crawford, first published as a serial\
  \ in Blackwood's Magazine and then as a book in New York (Macmillan) and Edinburgh\
  \ (Blackwood) in 1887. Set chiefly in Rome of twenty years earlier, the novel paints\
  \ a rich picture of the period, detailing the spiritual and economic problems of\
  \ the aristocracy at a time when its influence and status were under attack from\
  \ the emerging forces of modernity. This romance tells the tale of Giovanni Saracinesca\
  \ and his courting of Corona d'Astradente, complete with intrigue and sword fights\
  \ (Crawford was an expert fencer). It can be categorized as a work of historical\
  \ fiction in that it relates a time when the author was only a child, and also in\
  \ the sense that the particulars of that time and place are carefully delineated.\
  \ In a sense, Crawford had been researching for this book all his life: his parents\
  \ had witnessed the brief 1848 revolution, and his cousin, in her memoirs of Crawford,\
  \ insisted that \"[t]here is little doubt that Crawford as a boy had heard first-hand\
  \ descriptions of [the] exciting events\" of the 1860s.\nSaracinesca proved to be\
  \ both an immediate hit and Crawford's greatest critical success. It was also a\
  \ commercial triumph: he negotiated separate contracts for the serial printing and\
  \ the simultaneous American and British publication, as well as future royalties.\
  \ He followed it with two brilliant sequels, Sant' Ilario and Don Orsino, the three\
  \ of which are usually considered a trilogy. Subsequent sequels, such as Corleone,\
  \ continue the saga of Saracinesca family, but with a diversion from the previous\
  \ focus on the drama and status of family members into heavily plotted, incident-heavy\
  \ melodrama. Characters from Saracinesca and its sequels also appear in A Lady of\
  \ Rome (1906) and The White Sister (1909).\nCrawford, though an American by parentage\
  \ and citizenship, was born in the Italian resort of Bagni de Lucca, spent most\
  \ of his life abroad, and wrote Saracinesca while living in Sant' Agnello di Sorrento,\
  \ Italy.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
